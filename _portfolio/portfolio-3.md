3D platformer with graphics inspired by games like paper mario, I worked solely on the code whilst the art was made by a friend of mine, development for this game is currently on hiatus

This game was developed for a game jam, I got out of my comfort zone while developing this game (as it is in 3D) and learned a lot from this experience
